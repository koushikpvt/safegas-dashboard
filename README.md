# 🛡️ SafeGas Dashboard

A real-time IoT dashboard for monitoring gas leaks, servo activity, and alert events — built with ESP32, Supabase, and React.

## 🚀 Overview

SafeGas is a safety-focused system that detects hazardous gas levels, triggers servo-based shutoff mechanisms, and logs contextual data to the cloud. This dashboard visualizes live sensor data, servo rotation history, and alert status — all in a clean, responsive UI.
